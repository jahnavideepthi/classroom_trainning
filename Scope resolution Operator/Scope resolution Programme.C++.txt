Defnition
The scope resolution operator ( :: ) is used for several reasons. 
For example:
If the global variable name is same as local variable name, the scope resolution operator will be used to call the 
global variable. It is also used to define a function outside the class and used to access the static variables of class.

Programme

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
char a = 'm';
static int b = 50;

int main() {
   char a = 's';

   cout << "The static variable : "<< ::b;
   cout << "\nThe local variable : " << a;
   cout << "\nThe global variable : " << ::a;
   
   return 0;
}
