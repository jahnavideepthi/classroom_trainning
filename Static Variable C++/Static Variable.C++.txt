Defnition

A static variable is a variable that is declared using the keyword static. The space for the static variable is allocated only one time and this is used for the entirety of the program.

Once this variable is declared, it exists till the program executes. So, the lifetime of a static variable is the lifetime of the program.

Programme
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
void func() {
   static int num = 1;
   cout <<"Value of num: "<< num <<"\n";
   num++;
}
int main() {
   func();
   func();
   func();
   return 0;
}
